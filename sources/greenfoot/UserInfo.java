/**
 * <p>The UserInfo class can be used to store data permanently on a server, and
 * to share this data between different users, when the scenario runs on the
 * Greenfoot web site. This can be used to implement shared high score tables
 * or other examples of shared data.</p>
 *
 * <p>Storage is only available when the current user is logged in on the Greenfoot
 * site, so for some users storage will not be available. Always use
 * UserInfo.isStorageAvailable() to check before accessing the user data.</p>
 *
 * <p>A typical code snippet for storing a high score is as follows:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     if (UserInfo.isStorageAvailable()) {
 *         UserInfo myInfo = UserInfo.getMyInfo();
 *         if (newScore &gt; myInfo.getScore()) {
 *             myInfo.setScore(newScore);
 *             myInfo.store();  // write back to server
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>Methods to retrieve user data include getting data for the current user
 * (getMyInfo()), the top scorers (e.g. getTop(10) for the top 10), and data
 * for users with scores near my own score (e.g. getNearby(10)).</p>
 *
 * <p>The data that can be stored for each user consists of a score, 10
 * additional general purpose integers, and 5 strings (limited to 50 characters
 * in length). In addition, the user name and user's image can be retrieved from
 * the user data.</p>
 *
 * <p>For testing purposes, while running within Greenfoot (not on the web site),
 * the user name can be set in the preferences (CTRL-SHIFT-P / CMD-SHIFT-P).
 * This allows to simulate different users during development. When running
 * on the web site, the user name is the name used to log in to the site.</p>
