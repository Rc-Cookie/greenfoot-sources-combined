 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>"a", "b", .., "z" (alphabetical keys), "0".."9" (digits), most
 *     punctuation marks. getKey() also returns uppercase characters when
 *     appropriate.
 * <li>"up", "down", "left", "right" (the cursor keys)
 * <li>"enter", "space", "tab", "escape", "backspace", "shift", "control"
 * <li>"F1", "F2", .., "F12" (the function keys)
 * </ul>
