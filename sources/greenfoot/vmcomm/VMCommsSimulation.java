     * Shared memory documentation (this comment may get moved to somewhere more appropriate later).
     *
     * The shared memory consists of two successive lumps of memory. One is used by the server VM to
     * transmit data, and the other is used by the debug VM for the same purpose. File locks protect
     * both regions to prevent (in cases where it matters) either side from reading a potentially
     * incomplete data frame while the other side is still writing it. The locking protocol is
     * described in VMCommsMain.
     * 
     * Its format is as follows, where each position is an integer position (i.e. bytes times four):
     * 
     * Server area (16kb):
     * Pos 0: Reserved. Currently this region is locked independently; the "real" server area starts
     *        following this position.
     * Pos 1: When the number is negative, it indicates that the server VM has sent back
     *        information to the debug VM to read.  This includes keyboard and mouse events,
     *        as shown below.
     * Pos 2: The last consumed image frame received from the debug VM. Note that the debug VM
     *        should not update the image in the buffer until the current image is consumed
     *        (otherwise there may be paint artifacts such as tearing). 
     * Pos 3: Count of commands (C), can be zero
     * Pos 4 onwards:
     *        Commands.  Each command begins with an integer sequence ID, then has
     *        an integer length (L), followed by L integers (L >= 1).
     *        The first integer of the L integers is always the
     *        command type, and the amount of other integers depend on the command.  For example,
     *        GreenfootStage.COMMAND_RUN just has the command type integer and no more, whereas
     *        mouse events have four integers.
     *
     * Debug VM area (10M - 16kb): [Positions relative to beginning]
     * 
     * Pos 0: Sequence index when the current (included) image was painted (the image is included
     *        unchanged in subsequent frames).
     * Pos 1: Width of world image in pixels (W)
     * Pos 2: Height of world image in pixels (H)
     * Pos 3 incl to 3+(W*H) excl, if W and H are both greater than zero:
     *        W * H pixels one row at a time with no gaps, each pixel is one
     *        integer, in BGRA form, i.e. blue is highest 8 bits, alpha is lowest.
     * Pos 3+(W*H): Sequence ID of most recently processed command, or -1 if N/A.
     * Pos 4+(W*H): Stopped-with-error count.  (If this goes up, server VM will bring terminal to front)
     * Pos 5+(W*H) and 6+(W*H): Two ints (highest bits first) with value of System.currentTimeMillis()
     *                          at the point when some execution that may contain user code last started on
     *                          the simulation thread, or 0L if user code is not currently running.
     * Pos 7+(W*H): The current simulation speed (1 to 100)
     * Pos 8+(W*H): world counter if a world is currently installed, or 0 if there is no world.
     * Pos 9+(W*H): The world cell size in pixels
     * Pos 10+(W*H): -1 if not currently awaiting a Greenfoot.ask() answer.
     *              If awaiting, it is count (P) of following codepoints which make up prompt.
     * Pos 11+(W*H) to 11+(W*H)+P excl: codepoints making up ask prompt.
     * Pos 11+(W*H)+P: 1 if the the delay loop is currently running, or 0 otherwise.
