 * An Actor is an object that exists in the Greenfoot world. 
 * Every Actor has a location in the world, and an appearance (that is:
 * an icon).
 * 
 * <p>An Actor is not normally instantiated, but instead used as a superclass
 * to more specific objects in the world. Every object that is intended to appear
 * in the world must extend Actor. Subclasses can then define their own
 * appearance and behaviour.
 * 
 * <p>One of the most important aspects of this class is the 'act' method. This method
 * is called when the 'Act' or 'Run' buttons are activated in the Greenfoot interface.
 * The method here is empty, and subclasses normally provide their own implementations.
