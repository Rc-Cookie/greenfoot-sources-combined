/**
 * There are two ways that the mouse can be handled in Greenfoot. One is the
 * built-in mouse support like it was in Greenfoot release 1.3.0 and earlier.
 * This still works the same way in newer Greenfoot versions as long as the
 * simulation is not running. When the simulation is running there is no default
 * mouse support for dragging objects already added into the world. When the
 * simulation is running the user classes have to poll for mouse information
 * through the greenfoot.Greenfoot class.
 * <p>
 * MouseEvents are collected in frames. A frame is defined as the interval
 * between the first poll of anything in the previous act-round to the first
 * poll in the current act-round.
 * <p>
 * When the first poll in an act loop happens, the future mouse data is copied
 * into current mouseInfo and the creation of a new future mouse data object is
 * started.
 * <p>
 * 
 * If several events happen in the same frame the events are prioritized like
 * this: <br>
 * Priorities with highest priority first:
 * <ul>
 * <li> dragEnd </li>
 * <li> click </li>
 * <li> press </li>
 * <li> drag </li>
 * <li> move </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * In general only one event can happen in a frame, the only exception is click
 * and press which could happen in the same frame if a mouse is clicked in one
 * frame. <br>
 * If several of the same type of event happens, then the last one is used.
 * <p>
 * If, for instance, two buttons are pressed at the same time, the behaviour is
 * undefined. Maybe we should define it so that button1 always have higher
 * priority than button2 and button2 always higher than button3. But not
 * necessarily documenting this to the user.
