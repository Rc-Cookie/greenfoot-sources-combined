/**
 * A class defining the debugger primitives needed by BlueJ. May be supported by different
 * implementations, locally or remotely.
 * 
 * <p>Debugger has a listener interface to allow listening for certain events. Events reported to
 * the listener are guaranteed to be serialised, that is, a callback will not be entered while
 * the previous callback is still executing.
 * 
 * <p>Part of the listener interface is notification of debugger state changes. There possible
 * states are UNKNOWN, NOTREADY, IDLE, RUNNING, SUSPENDED and LAUNCH_FAILED. Only certain
 * transitions are possible:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>UNKNOWN to NOTREADY: when the debugger is first launched
 * <li>NOTREADY to IDLE:  when the debugger finishes launching or restarting
 * <li>IDLE to RUNNING:  when the debugger begins execution of user code
 * <li>IDLE to NOTREADY:  when the virtual machine restarts (possibly for external reasons)
 * <li>RUNNING to IDLE:  when user code finishes or is otherwise terminated
 * <li>RUNNING to SUSPENDED:  when a breakpoint is hit etc.
 * <li>SUSPENDED to RUNNING:  when execution is continued after a breakpoint etc.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Transitions that do not conform to the list are modified by inserting appropriate transitions.
 * For instance a transition from RUNNING to NOTREADY is represented as a transition first to
 * IDLE and then to NOTREADY.
